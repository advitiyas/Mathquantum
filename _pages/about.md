**Present Technology**

Quantum designed aerospace technology is still in its very early phases. Quantum computers have recently developed an optimized version of a radiologic nuclear battery based on high energy gamma rays. Current research indicates that quantum computers have the ability to double the efficiency of photovoltaics by enabling two electrons per photon. The testing of quantum made and optimized materials is also being used in space to identify and measure vacuum energy and dark matter.

**History Of Quantum Computing**

Quantum computing was first proposed in the 1980s but was not harnessed for aerospace technologies until recently. A successful 2 bit quantum computer was built in 1998, which could solve new quantum algorithms such as Groverâ€™s algorithm. Further improvements in semiconductors and microprocessors were also made great progress in the quantum computing industry which significantly reduced costs and sizes of integrated circuits. Recently, A study in 2014 timed a quantum computer solving the travelling salesman problem in significantly less time than a classical computer, even increasing its difficulty.
