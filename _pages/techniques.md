**Techniques necessary for this field**

The techniques necessary for this field are linear algebra and calculus. Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies linear equations, vector spaces, and linear mappings between them. This is a very useful field for quantum information science because qubits are able to be represented as vectors and can be mapped out. Additionally calculus topics such as optimization and differential equations are necessary to build and develop new parts for rockets and optimize propulsion systems and resource allocation.

**Breakthroughs**

Quantum computers need more qubits to perform the kinds of tasks being hypothesized currently by scientists. As the amount of qubits of a quantum computer increases, the computing power increases exponentially. Quantum computers must sense and learn to differentiate between materials, chemicals, and machines on the spacecraft before they can start optimizing. Quantum computers must also learn how to engineer  a successful space craft, which may need to be integrated with Artificial Intelligence beforehand.

**Future Quantum Technology**

Current quantum computers do not have the quantity of qubits necessary to fully support the type of optimization and simulation technology explained. In the future, algorithms will be able to optimize parameters such as resource management on the spacecraft, optimize spacecraft paths and fuel supply, simulate the environmental conditions of outer-space and other planets to better equip rockets for harsh conditions, and optimize instrument activity timings like experiments to enhance accurate data collection. Years from now, quantum computing and algorithm can be used for the building of spacecraft and rockets themselves by analyzing and comparing design possibilities in a tenth of a second, as well as streamlining technologiecal, mechanical, and engineering decisions. In the future, quantum computers will also be able to make the most ethical and environmentally sustainable decisions by hypothesizing materials and methods to install them.

**Quantum and Aerospace Ethical Concerns**

Quantum computing optimized aerospace design is a technology that has the possibility to change the way spacecrafts are inherently made. This can be used for good such as in exploring space, discovering planets, and sustainable living purposes; however, this risks countries using such technology to develop nuclear missiles and weapons by optimizing their trajectories and points of contact. Such enhanced weapons can harm billions of innocent civilians, which makes it imperative that this information is controlled and utilized only with the utmost consideration and deliberation. Additionally, such advanced quantum technology comes with its own fair share of risks including data and security breaches for classical technology.
